vtf-spray-installer
===================

VTF spray installer for Valve Source games

This program is meant to help with the importing of VTF (Valve Texture Format) sprays in Valve games (e.g. Team Fortress
2), freeing the user from having to create VMT files for them and automatically placing them in the right spot.

This program has no installer - just download the .EXE and go! VTF files can be selected by the program simply by
gragging and dropping them onto the window, and can be installed by pressing Save Spray to Game. The batch mode
facilitates installing multiple sprays at once to a game, each with the required VMT files being generated.

Eventually, this will turn into a full-blown spray manager, with preview thumbnails and options to delete sprays, though
that will be down the road.

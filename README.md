vtf-spray-installer
===================

VTF spray importer for Valve Source games

This program is meant to help with the importing of VTF (Valve Texture Format) sprays in Valve games (e.g. Team Fortress
2), freeing the user from having to create VMT files for them and automatically placing them in the right spot.

If you wish just to use the application, head over to http://vampyrium.net/sprayimporter/ and download the ZIP file.

Eventually, this will turn into a full-blown spray manager, with preview thumbnails and options to delete sprays, though
that will be down the road.
